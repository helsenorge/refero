2.6.3
-----
* Changed the version of moment to "2.22.2" because that version is used by MinHelse 

2.6.1
-----
* Use @helsenorge/toolkit v6.2.1

2.6.0
-----
* Introduce a new property 'validationSummaryPlacement' to control the
  placement of the form validation summary. Possible values are:

    ValidationSummaryPlacement.Top
    ValidationSummaryPlacement.Bottom

  If nothing is specified, it defaults to ValidationSummaryPlacement.Top.

2.5.1
-----
* enableWhen-components that were generated by a repeat used to be expanded as
  default. This behaviour have now been fixed, so that these components are
  properly expanded according to their criteria.

2.5.0
-----
* Item type of attachment with repeat set to true, will render to a component
  that can handle upload of multiple files. The component will for that reason
  render without the repeat and delete buttons.

2.4.0
-----
* Added public API to control what file types and file sizes are valid for
  attachments.

2.3.0
-----
* Added support for helpitems.

  Help for an item can be defined using another item that is a direct
  descendant of the item in question. This helpitem must be of type "text" and
  implement the itemControl-extension with a code value of "help". Eg.

  {
    linkId: "1",
    text: "This is a question",
    type: "group",
    item: [
      {
        extension: [
          {
            url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
              valueCodeableConcept: {
                coding: [
                  {
                    system: "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/questionnaire-item-control",
                    code: "help"
                  }
                ]
              }
          }
        ],
        linkId: "1.0.1",
        text: "This is the help text for the item with linkId 1",
        type: "text"
      }
    ]
  }

2.2.2
-----
* Added component specific css classes for all components.
